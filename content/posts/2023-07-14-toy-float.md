Many words have been written on IEEE754 (binary) floating point numbers. I
particularly like the illustrations in Bartosz Ciechanowski's
[Exposing Floating Point](https://ciechanow.ski/exposing-floating-point/)
article, and Michael Matloka's interactive visualizations in
[Floating-point arithmetic â€“ all you need to know, explained interactively](https://matloka.com/blog/floating-point-101).

Let's get our hands dirty by writing a toy arbitrary-precision floating point
implementation in Rust. Having an arbitrary-precision implementation is useful
for pedagogical purposes, because a good mental model for IEEE754 floating point
computations is to pretend that each computation happens in ideal math land, and
is then brought back down to finite precision land as a separate post-processing
step.

We'll start with designing a data structure to hold an arbitrary-precision
floating point value. We'll be using types from the
[`num-bigint`](https://docs.rs/num-bigint/latest/num_bigint/) crate as building
blocks to help us do arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic, which will be
necessary for the mantissa. Using a fixed-width integer type for the exponent
will be sufficient, because changes to it make the number grow, well, exponentially.

Floating point values subdivide into four distinct categories: regulars, zeros,
infinities, and NaNs. The first three are signed. For zeros that may be a bit
surprising, but it's important to distinguish between negative zero and positive
zero for some numeric operations. No behavior is ascribed to the sign bit of NaNs.

The `num_bigint::BigInt` type already has a sign field. Its sign is actually
an enum with three states: `pub enum Sign { Minus, NoSign, Plus }`. It may
appear that `NoSign` is less useful for us as it may create some representational
redundancies and fly in the face of the principle of "making invalid states
unrepresentable", but we'll actually find it useful later on.

What we will do, however, is only grant exponents to regular floats, by hiding
it away inside the `Regular` enum variant.

```Rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
enum FloatKind {
    Regular { exp: i32 },
    Zero,
    Infinity,
    NaN,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct ArbFloat {
    kind: FloatKind,
    num: BigInt,
}

impl ArbFloat {
    fn new(kind: FloatKind, num: BigInt) -> Self {
        Self { kind, num }
    }
}
```

Let's write a routine for ingesting a floating-point number in a prescribed
format. There are many IEEE754-like storage formats, and they're defined by
how many bits each bitfield has (mantissa and exponent). We'll start by
having a struct that represents a particular float storage format, and some
convenience methods which will allow us to write code that is parametric over
that format. For simplicity's sake, we'll only support storage formats up to
64 bits in size. This fits formats like `binary16` (half-precision),
`bfloat16` ("brain floating point"), `binary32` (single-precision),
and `binary64` (double-precision).

```Rust
type IntStorage = u64;

#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct FormatDesc {
    frac_bits: u8,
    exp_bits: u8,
}

impl FormatDesc {
    const BINARY32: Self = Self {
        frac_bits: 23,
        exp_bits: 8,
    };
    const BINARY64: Self = Self {
        frac_bits: 52,
        exp_bits: 11,
    };

    fn precision(&self) -> i32 {
        self.frac_bits as i32 + 1
    }

    fn mask(bits: u32) -> IntStorage {
        IntStorage::MAX >> (IntStorage::BITS - bits)
    }

    fn frac_mask(&self) -> IntStorage {
        Self::mask(self.frac_bits as u32)
    }

    fn frac_shift(&self) -> IntStorage {
        0
    }

    fn biased_exp_mask(&self) -> IntStorage {
        Self::mask(self.exp_bits as u32)
    }

    fn biased_exp_shift(&self) -> IntStorage {
        self.frac_shift() + self.frac_bits as IntStorage
    }

    fn exp_bias(&self) -> i32 {
        (1 << (self.exp_bits - 1)) - 1
    }

    fn sign_mask(&self) -> IntStorage {
        1
    }

    fn sign_shift(&self) -> IntStorage {
        self.biased_exp_shift() + self.exp_bits as IntStorage
    }

    fn integer_bit(&self) -> IntStorage {
        1 << self.frac_bits
    }
}
```

Great. Now let's get parsing.

```Rust
fn parse(desc: FormatDesc, storage: IntStorage) -> ArbFloat {
    let frac = (storage >> desc.frac_shift()) & desc.frac_mask();
    let biased_exp = (storage >> desc.biased_exp_shift()) & desc.biased_exp_mask();
    let sign = ((storage >> desc.sign_shift()) & desc.sign_mask()) != 0;

    // We add the precision to the bias to be able to interpret the fraction
    // field as an integer rather than as a fixed-point number in [1, 2).
    // We've essentially moved the radix point to the right by multiplying
    // the fraction by `2^(precision - 1)`, so we compensate by subtracting
    // `precision - 1` from the exponent.
    let exp = biased_exp as i32 - (desc.exp_bias() + desc.precision() - 1);
    let mut num = BigInt::from(if sign { -1 } else { 1 });
    let kind = if biased_exp == desc.biased_exp_mask() {
        if frac == 0 {
            FloatKind::Infinity
        } else {
            FloatKind::NaN
        }
    } else if biased_exp == 0 {
        if frac == 0 {
            FloatKind::Zero
        } else {
            // Subnormals. Multiply by `frac` here only to preserve the sign of zeros.
            num *= frac;
            FloatKind::Regular { exp: exp + 1 }
        }
    } else {
        num *= frac | desc.integer_bit();
        FloatKind::Regular { exp }
    };
    ArbFloat::new(kind, num)
}
```

This is a bit gnarly, but then so is IEEE754. :wink:
Let's see what this prints out for a couple of examples:
```Rust
fn print_examples() {
    println!("{:?}", parse(FormatDesc::BINARY32, 0x8000_0000)); // -0f32
    println!("{:?}", parse(FormatDesc::BINARY32, 0x7F80_0000)); // f32::INFINITY
    println!("{:?}", parse(FormatDesc::BINARY32, 0x7FC0_0000)); // f32::NAN
    println!("{:?}", parse(FormatDesc::BINARY32, 0x3F80_0000)); // 1f32
    println!("{:?}", parse(FormatDesc::BINARY64, 0x3FF0_0000_0000_0000)); // 1f64
}
```
This prints out:
```
ArbFloat { kind: Zero, num: -1 }
ArbFloat { kind: Infinity, num: 1 }
ArbFloat { kind: NaN, num: -1 }
ArbFloat { kind: Regular { exp: -23 }, num: 8388608 }
ArbFloat { kind: Regular { exp: -52 }, num: 4503599627370496 }
```
This is almost right, but we're now faced with an inconvenient reality of
floating-point numbers: uniqueness of representation is not a given, it must be
earned! In particular, we see here two different representations for the number 1.

In the IEEE754 storage formats, this situation is neatly defined away by saying
that the mantissa always represents a number between `[1, 2)`, and not explicitly
storing the integer bit -- the single digit above the radix point, which is always 1.
In other words, they are always _normalized_. Well, excepting _subnormals_. They
are not normalized, because to normalize them, we need to pull their highest set
mantissa bit up to the integer bit's position, which would mean subtracting up
to `precision - 1` from the exponent, which would then underflow (since it's
already as small as it can get).

So what do we do? Well, we could just "right-justify" the `BigInt` to the best
degree we can. We do depart from the usual perspective of putting our anchor
"to the left" of the number. We're just shifting the complexity around to the
rounding step, but we'll be fine.

```diff
impl ArbFloat {
-    fn new(kind: FloatKind, num: BigInt) -> Self {
-        Self { kind, num }
+    fn new(mut kind: FloatKind, mut num: BigInt) -> Self {
+        if let FloatKind::Regular { exp } = &mut kind {
+            let adjustment = num.trailing_zeros().unwrap() as i32;
+            *exp += adjustment;
+            num >>= adjustment;
+        }
+        Self { kind, num }
    }
}
```

Re-running, we now get the following output:
```Rust
ArbFloat { kind: Zero, num: -1 }
ArbFloat { kind: Infinity, num: 1 }
ArbFloat { kind: NaN, num: 1 }
ArbFloat { kind: Regular { exp: 0 }, num: 1 }
ArbFloat { kind: Regular { exp: 0 }, num: 1 }
```

Next time, we'll take a shot at implementing multiplication and rounding.
